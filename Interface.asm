;-----------------------------------------------------------

; Initialization of the Microprocessor System

ORG 0x1000        ; Program starts at memory address 0x1000
START:
    MOV A, #0x00  ; Initialize A to 0
    MOV B, #0x00  ; Initialize B to 0
    MOV SP, #0x200 ; Set Stack Pointer to address 0x200

; --- MEMORY INTERFACE AND ADDRESS DECODING ---
; Memory Address Decoding: Accessing memory address ranges
    MOV DPTR, #0x3000   ; Load Data Pointer with memory address 0x3000
    MOVX A, @DPTR       ; Access memory using indirect addressing
    MOV [0x4000], A     ; Store A in memory location 0x4000

; --- CACHE MEMORY INTERFACE ---
; Assume we have a simple Cache Controller with 4 blocks
CACHE_BLOCK_1:
    MOV A, [0x5000]     ; Load data from memory address 0x5000 (cache block 1)
    MOV B, A            ; Store data in B
    MOV [0x6000], A     ; Write back to memory from cache block 1
    
CACHE_BLOCK_2:
    MOV A, [0x7000]     ; Load data from memory address 0x7000 (cache block 2)
    MOV [0x8000], A     ; Write back to memory from cache block 2

; --- I/O INTERFACE ---
; I/O Port: Keyboard Interface (Poll for key press)
KEYBOARD_INTERFACE:
    MOV A, [0x9000]     ; Read from keyboard buffer (address 0x9000)
    CMP A, #0x00        ; Check if a key is pressed
    JZ  NO_KEY          ; If no key is pressed, jump to NO_KEY
    MOV B, A            ; Store the key pressed into B

NO_KEY:
    ; If no key is pressed, continue to poll the keyboard

; Timer Interface: Timer Interrupt (Simulate a timer overflow)
TIMER_INTERFACE:
    MOV A, [0xA000]     ; Read timer overflow status from address 0xA000
    CMP A, #0x01        ; Check if timer overflowed
    JZ  TIMER_OVERFLOW   ; If timer overflowed, jump to TIMER_OVERFLOW

TIMER_OVERFLOW:
    MOV B, #0xFF        ; Set B to 0xFF to indicate timer overflow

; --- INTERRUPT CONTROLLER ---
; Assume IRQ0 is a basic interrupt line triggered when a device requests attention.
INTERRUPT_CONTROLLER:
    MOV A, [0xB000]     ; Read interrupt status from IRQ0 register
    CMP A, #0x01        ; Check if interrupt request is active
    JZ  IRQ_TRIGGERED    ; If interrupt triggered, jump to IRQ_TRIGGERED

IRQ_TRIGGERED:
    MOV B, #0x01        ; Indicate interrupt processing
    ; Process interrupt here

; --- DMA CONTROLLER ---
; Assume DMA controller provides direct memory access
DMA_CONTROLLER:
    MOV A, [0xC000]     ; Read DMA status register
    CMP A, #0x01        ; Check if DMA transfer is complete
    JZ  DMA_TRANSFER_COMPLETE   ; If DMA transfer is complete, jump

DMA_TRANSFER_COMPLETE:
    MOV B, #0x01        ; Indicate DMA transfer completion
    ; Handle the DMA data transfer completion here

; --- VIDEO CONTROLLER INTERFACE ---
; Assume video controller maps display memory to specific address ranges
VIDEO_CONTROLLER:
    MOV DPTR, #0xD000   ; Load Data Pointer to video memory address 0xD000
    MOVX A, @DPTR       ; Fetch video data from the display memory
    MOV [0xE000], A     ; Store data to a specific video address (write to screen buffer)

; --- COMMUNICATION INTERFACE (UART or SPI) ---
; Assume UART communication interface
UART_INTERFACE:
    MOV A, [0xF000]     ; Read data from UART receive buffer
    CMP A, #0x00        ; Check if data is available
    JZ  NO_DATA         ; If no data available, jump to NO_DATA
    MOV B, A            ; Store the received data in register B
    ; Process the received data here

NO_DATA:
    ; No data received, continue monitoring UART

; --- End of Program ---
END:
    HLT                 ; Halt execution of the program

;-----------------------------------------------------------
; Explanation:
; - Bus Timings: Managed by the CPU based on address and control signals (e.g., READ, WRITE)
; - Memory Address Decoding: Mapping of addresses to memory or peripherals (done by decoders)
; - Cache: Cache blocks store frequently used data, reducing memory latency
; - Keyboard Interface: Polls for key press and stores the pressed key
; - Timer Interface: Monitors timer overflow status
; - Interrupt Controller: Manages interrupt requests and processing
; - DMA: Handles data transfers between peripherals and memory without CPU intervention
; - Video: Video controller handles display memory and screen output
; - Communication: Interface with UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) for serial communication
