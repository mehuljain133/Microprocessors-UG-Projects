;-----------------------------------------------------------
; This code demonstrates:
; - Microprocessor Architecture (Registers, Stack, Flags)
; - Programming Model (Control flow, conditionals)
; - Addressing Modes (Immediate, Direct, Indirect, Register)
; - Data Movement Instructions (MOV, PUSH, POP, etc.)
;-----------------------------------------------------------

; Assuming a hypothetical microprocessor with:
; - Registers: A (Accumulator), B (General-purpose), C (Counter), SP (Stack Pointer)
; - Flags: Zero (Z), Carry (C), Sign (S), Overflow (V)
; - Stack: Push/Pop operations for memory management

; Start of Program Memory (location 0x1000)
ORG 0x1000        ; Program starts at memory address 0x1000

; Initialize Registers
START:
    MOV A, #0x55  ; Load immediate value 0x55 into A (Accumulator)
    MOV B, #0x02  ; Load immediate value 0x02 into B (General-purpose Register)
    MOV C, #0x00  ; Initialize C (Counter register) to 0
    MOV SP, #0x200 ; Initialize Stack Pointer at address 0x200

; 1. Immediate Addressing Mode: Load A with a constant value
    MOV A, #0xAA  ; A = 0xAA

; 2. Direct Addressing Mode: Load from a specific memory address
    MOV A, [0x4000]   ; A = content at memory address 0x4000

; 3. Indirect Addressing Mode: Load from a memory address specified by DPTR
    MOV DPTR, #0x5000 ; Load DPTR (Data Pointer) with address 0x5000
    MOVX A, @DPTR     ; Load A with the value at the address pointed by DPTR

; 4. Register Addressing Mode: Data transfer between registers
    MOV A, B          ; Move content of B into A
    MOV B, A          ; Move content of A back to B

; 5. Example of Data Movement Instructions: Store to Memory
    MOV [0x6000], A   ; Store value of A into memory address 0x6000
    MOV [0x6001], B   ; Store value of B into memory address 0x6001

; 6. Stack Operations: Push A onto the stack and Pop into C
    PUSH A            ; Push value of A onto the stack
    POP C             ; Pop value from the stack into C

; 7. Arithmetic with Flag Updates (Conditionals based on flags)
    ADD A, #0x01     ; Add 1 to A (A = A + 1)
    JC CARRY_SET     ; If Carry is set, jump to CARRY_SET
    JZ ZERO_SET      ; If Zero flag is set, jump to ZERO_SET

; Conditional Handling based on Flags
CARRY_SET:
    ; If Carry flag is set after addition
    MOV B, #0xFF      ; Set B to 0xFF if carry is set
    JMP END            ; Jump to end of program

ZERO_SET:
    ; If Zero flag is set after addition
    MOV B, #0x00      ; Set B to 0x00 if zero flag is set
    JMP END            ; Jump to end of program

; 8. Looping using the Register Addressing Mode
LOOP_START:
    MOV A, C          ; Copy C (Counter) to A
    DEC A             ; Decrement A (A = A - 1)
    MOV C, A          ; Copy result back to C
    JNZ LOOP_START    ; If A is not zero, repeat the loop

; 9. Memory Access via Indirect Addressing with Stack Operations
    MOV DPTR, #0x7000 ; Load DPTR with address 0x7000
    MOVX A, @DPTR     ; Load A with content from address pointed by DPTR
    MOV [0x7001], A   ; Store A to memory location 0x7001

; End of Program
END:
    HLT               ; Halt execution (End of program)
